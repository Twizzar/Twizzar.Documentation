The Twizzar configuration is used for unit test generation and navigation, and therefore it is separated into two files.
One containing the templates used for controlling the code created, the other is used for defining the destination where the generated tests are located. The configuration files are automatically generated if they don't exist in the moment of test creation. They are located at the same level as the Visual Studio solution file and have to be manually added to the source control.

- [Mapping](./mapping)
- [Templating](./templating)
